    <div class="entry-wrapper">
        <p class="date">9/7/23</p>
        <p>> almost a year since the first update.</p>
        <p>> and this is the third one...</p>
        <p>> to be fair, not much development was done</p>
        <p>> slc got some cleanup and a few new features</p>
        <p>> actually getting files to use is such a headache i don't think i will be adding any more anytime soon</p>
        <p>> but i've been working on something new!</p>
        <p>> recently i have been playing a lot of overwatch</p>
        <p>> i've been working on a new website to let you search for players and get info about them</p>
        <p>> as of this very moment there is no url but i suspect it will look like: <a class="link" href="http://stevelovesow.com">stevelovesow.com</a></p>
        <p>> (.io domains are so expensive!) </p>
        <div class="break"></div>
        <p class="header">goals:</p>
        <p>> i'll try and deploy slow (stevelovesow.com) soon</p>
        <p>> i dont have many plans for slc at the moment still lots to do but...</p>
        <p>> lots of potential data with this slow thing... maybe try and add large player stat tracking</p>
        <p>> i hope to make this new website especially mobile frendly... most of my previous work has not been so pretty on mobile</p>
